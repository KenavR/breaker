## Introduction

Breaker, breaker, this is open source, over.

[Breaker](https://www.breakerapp.com/) is like IRC or Slack, but made just for Reddit. Users connect with their Reddit account and can join chat rooms for every subreddit. Since Breaker is built for reddit Breaker has a tighter integration with subreddit settings like flair, banned users, and user statistics.

Mods of each subreddit are automatically mods of their subreddit room. Mods can set the karma threshold to chat, customize styling, ban users, kick users, etc. 

Chat with us over at http://www.breakerapp.com/r/breakerapp!
