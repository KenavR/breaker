How to install and develop extensions
---

* Go to chrome://extensions/
* Enable developer mode
* Click "Load Unpacked Extension"
* Select this folder

And it should be good to go, when you visit any reddit page it should work.

Also recommended, this extension which makes reloading extensions you're developing easier:

Note: That extension can't seem to reload changes to the manifest file.
